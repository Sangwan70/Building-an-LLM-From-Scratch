# Part 3: GPT Model from Scratch

- [flops-analysis.ipynb](flops-analysis.ipynb) analyses the floating point operations per second (FLOPS) of the GPT model(s) implemented in the main part. 
- [previous_parts.py](previous_parts.py) is a Python module containing the `GPTModel` code we implemented in part 3 and other code implemented in previous parts, which we import in the analysis notebook.
- `requirements-extra.txt` includes additional Python libraries that need to be installed (via `pip install -r requirements-extra.txt`.
