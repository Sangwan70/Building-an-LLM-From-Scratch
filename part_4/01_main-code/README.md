# Part 4: Pretraining on Unlabeled Data

### Main Code

- [part_4.ipynb](part_4.ipynb) contains all the code as it appears in the part.
- [previous_parts.py](previous_parts.py) is a Python module that contains the `MultiHeadAttention` module and `GPTModel` class from the previous partss, which we import in [part_4.ipynb](part_4.ipynb) to pretrain the GPT model
- [gpt_download.py](gpt_download.py) contains the utility functions for downloading the pretrained GPT model weights
- [additional_examples.ipynb](additional_examples.ipynb) contains the Additional Coding Examples for this part.

### Optional Code

- [gpt_train.py](gpt_train.py) is a standalone Python script file with the code that we implemented in [part_4.ipynb](part_4.ipynb) to train the GPT model (you can think of it as a code file summarizing this part.)
- [gpt_generate.py](gpt_generate.py) is a standalone Python script file with the code that we implemented in [part_4.ipynb](part_4.ipynb) to load and use the pretrained model weights from OpenAI
