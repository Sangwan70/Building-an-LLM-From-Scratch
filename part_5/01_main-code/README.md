# part 6: Finetuning for Classification

### Main part Code

- [part_5.ipynb](part_5.ipynb) contains all the code as it appears in the part
- [previous_parts.py](previous_parts.py)  is a Python module that contains the GPT model we coded and trained in previous parts, alongside many utility functions, which we reuse in this part
- [gpt_download.py](gpt_download.py) contains the utility functions for downloading the pretrained GPT model weights
- [additional_examples.ipynb](additional_examples.ipynb) contains the Example solutions for this part

### Optional Code

- [load-finetuned-model.ipynb](load-finetuned-model.ipynb) is a standalone Jupyter notebook to load the finetuned model we created in this part
- [gpt_class_finetune.py](gpt_class_finetune.py) is a standalone Python script file with the code that we implemented in [part_5.ipynb](part_5.ipynb) to finetune the GPT model (you can think of it as a part summary)
